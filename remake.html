                SangamX is created  as a platform that brings together a collection of capabilities needed to bring that free-market like effectiveness to the entire social impact sector – a markets mechanism we are calling Societal Markets.. a la Capital Markets, which will help magnify the impact per dollar per societal project.

Working in tandem with a Social Stock Exchange, our Societal Markets Framework creates a collection of capabilities needed to bring the societal free markets mechanism to life – some of these will be owned and operated by SangamX, while some will be owned/ operated by partners. We will leverage and connect existing mechanisms such as Social Stock Exchanges, match-making platforms, crowd-funding platforms etc. In doing so, we will role model a socially responsible AND financially sustainable organization, which establishes that financial return is only a means to create social returns, never the other way.
